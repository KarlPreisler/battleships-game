When entering the game the user will be asked to provide their name, once submitted the user and computers boards will be displayed.
Both boards will contain 5 rows and 5 columns, on the players board there are 4 ships, indicated with a "@".
The computers ships are hidden from the user, since showing them would defeat the object of the game.
Users can then choose a row and a column to try to hit the computers ships, and the computer is assigned random coordinates to try and hit the users ships.
All guesses that misses a ship are indicated with "X" on the boards, and any hit on a ship is indicated with "*". 

A hit increases the scores by 1.
